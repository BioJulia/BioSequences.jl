# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- The abstract `Sequence` type is now called `BioSequence{A}`.
- The type previously called `BioSequence{A}` is now `LongSequence{A}`.
- `Kmers` are now a parametric type: `Skipmer{U<:Unsigned, A<:Alphabet, M, N, K}`.
   A `Skipmer` is a more generic type of `Kmer`, where in addition to `K`, you have two other numeric parameters `M` and `N`. They are more fully described here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/19/179960.full.pdf+html

## [1.1.0]
### Changed
- Automatic conversion of `DNASequence` to `RNASequence` when translating sequences.
- Add `alternative_start` keyword argument to translate().
- Add abstract type for kmer iterators.

- Fixed indexing in ABIF records.

## [1.0.0] - 2018-08-23
### Added
- Issue and PR templates.
- Code of Conduct and Contributing files.

### Changed
- Update documentation generation.
- Fixes to type definition keywords.
- Bit-parallel GC counting.

## [0.8.0] - 2017-08-16
### Added
- Position weight matrix search functionality.
- A generalised composition method.
- `typemin` and `typemax` methods for `Kmer` types. 

### Changed
- `MinHash` function now generalised to `Reader` types.
- Updates to doc tests.

## [0.7.0] - 2017-07-28
### Added
- Support for julia v0.6 only. 

### Removed
- :exclamation: Dropped support for julia v0.5.

## [0.6.3] - 2017-07-06
### Changed
- Iterators.jl is not longer used as a dependency in favour of Itertools.jl.

## [0.6.1] - 2017-06-20

## [0.6.0] - 2017-06-14
### Added
- :arrow_up: Compatibility with julia v0.6.
- The `ungap` and `ungap!` methods, that are shorthand for filtering gaps from
  biological sequences.

### Changed
- Bug fixes for Kmer iteration that were caused by gaps in 4-bit encoded sequences.

## [0.5.0] - 2017-06-07
### Added
- All files pertaining to the old Bio.Seq module.
