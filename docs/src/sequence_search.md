# Searching for sequence motifs

There are many ways to search for particular motifs in biological sequences:

1. Exact searches, where you are looking for exact matches of a particular
   character of substring.
2. Approximate searches, where you are looking for sequences that are
   sufficiently similar to a given sequence or family of sequences.
3. Searches where you are looking for sequences that conform to some sort of
   pattern.

Like other Julia sequences such as `Vector`, you can search a `BioSequence` with the `findfirst(predicate, collection)` method pattern.

All these kinds of searches are provided in BioSequences.jl, and they all
conform to the `findnext`, `findprev`, and `occursin` patterns established in `Base` for
`String` and collections like `Vector`.

The exception is searching using the specialised
regex provided in this package, which as you shall see, conforms to the `match`
pattern established in `Base` for pcre and `String`s.

## Symbol search

```jldoctest
julia> seq = dna"ACAGCGTAGCT";

julia> findfirst(DNA_A, seq)
1

julia> findlast(DNA_A, seq)
8

findnext(DNA_A, seq, 2)
3

julia> findprev(DNA_A, seq, 7)
3

julia> findall(DNA_A, seq)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 3
 8
```

## Searching according to a pattern

### Regular expression search

Query patterns can be described in regular expressions. The syntax supports
a subset of Perl and PROSITE's notation.

Biological regexes can be constructed using the `BioRegex` constructor, for
example by doing `BioRegex{AminoAcid}("MV+")`. For bioregex literals, it is
instead recommended using the `@biore_str` macro:

The Perl-like syntax starts with `biore` (BIOlogical REgular expression)
and ends with a symbol option: "dna", "rna" or "aa". For example, `biore"A+"dna`
is a regular expression for DNA sequences and `biore"A+"aa` is for amino acid
sequences. The symbol options can be abbreviated to its first character: "d",
"r" or "a", respectively.

Here are examples of using the regular expression for `BioSequence`s:
```jldoctest
julia> match(biore"A+C*"dna, dna"AAAACC")
RegexMatch("AAAACC")

julia> match(biore"A+C*"d, dna"AAAACC")
RegexMatch("AAAACC")

julia> occursin(biore"A+C*"dna, dna"AAC")
true

julia> occursin(biore"A+C*"dna, dna"C")
false

```

`match` will return a `RegexMatch` if a match is found, otherwise it will return `nothing` if no match is found.

The table below summarizes available syntax elements.

| Syntax | Description | Example |
|:------:|:------------|:--------|
| `\|` | alternation | `"A\|T"` matches `"A"` and `"T"` |
| `*` | zero or more times repeat | `"TA*"` matches `"T"`, `"TA"` and `"TAA"` |
| `+` | one or more times repeat | `"TA+"` matches `"TA"` and `"TAA"` |
| `?` | zero or one time | `"TA?"` matches `"T"` and `"TA"` |
| `{n,}` | `n` or more times repeat | `"A{3,}"` matches `"AAA"` and `"AAAA"` |
| `{n,m}` | `n`-`m` times repeat | `"A{3,5}"` matches `"AAA"`, `"AAAA"` and `"AAAAA"`|
| `^` | the start of the sequence | `"^TAN*"` matches `"TATGT"` |
| `$` | the end of the sequence | `"N*TA$"` matches `"GCTA"` |
| `(...)` | pattern grouping | `"(TA)+"` matches `"TA"` and `"TATA"` |
| `[...]` | one of symbols | `"[ACG]+"` matches `"AGGC"` |

`eachmatch` and `findfirst` are also defined, just like usual regex and strings
found in `Base`.

```jldoctest
julia> collect(matched(x) for x in eachmatch(biore"TATA*?"d, dna"TATTATAATTA")) # overlap
4-element Vector{LongSequence{DNAAlphabet{4}}}:
 TAT  
 TAT
 TATA
 TATAA

julia> collect(matched(x) for x in eachmatch(biore"TATA*"d, dna"TATTATAATTA", false)) # no overlap
2-element Vector{LongSequence{DNAAlphabet{4}}}:
 TAT  
 TATAA

julia> findfirst(biore"TATA*"d, dna"TATTATAATTA")
1:3

julia> findfirst(biore"TATA*"d, dna"TATTATAATTA", 2)
4:8

```

Noteworthy differences from strings are:

* Ambiguous characters match any compatible characters (e.g. `biore"N"d` is equivalent to `biore"[ACGT]"d`).
* Whitespaces are ignored (e.g. `biore"A C G"d` is equivalent to `biore"ACG"d`).

The PROSITE notation is described in [ScanProsite - user
manual](https://prosite.expasy.org/scanprosite/scanprosite_doc.html). The syntax
supports almost all notations including the extended syntax. The PROSITE
notation starts with `prosite` prefix and no symbol option is needed because it
always describes patterns of amino acid sequences:

```jldoctest
julia> match(prosite"[AC]-x-V-x(4)-{ED}", aa"CPVPQARG")
RegexMatch("CPVPQARG")

julia> match(prosite"[AC]xVx(4){ED}", aa"CPVPQARG")
RegexMatch("CPVPQARG")

```


### Position weight matrix search

A motif can be specified using [position weight
matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_weight_matrix) (PWM) in a
probabilistic way.
This method searches for the first position in the sequence where a score
calculated using a PWM is greater than or equal to a threshold.
More formally, denoting the sequence as ``S`` and the PWM value of symbol ``s``
at position ``j`` as ``M_{s,j}``, the score starting from a position ``p`` is
defined as

```math
\operatorname{score}(S, p) = \sum_{i=1}^L M_{S[p+i-1],i}
```

and the search returns the smallest ``p`` that satisfies
``\operatorname{score}(S, p) \ge t``.

There are two kinds of matrices in this package: `PFM` and `PWM`. The `PFM` type
is a position frequency matrix and stores symbol frequencies for each position.
The `PWM` is a position weight matrix and stores symbol scores for each
position. You can create a `PFM` from a set of sequences with the same length
and then create a `PWM` from the `PFM` object.

```jldoctest
julia> motifs = [dna"TTA", dna"CTA", dna"ACA", dna"TCA", dna"GTA"]
5-element Vector{LongSequence{DNAAlphabet{4}}}:
 TTA
 CTA
 ACA
 TCA
 GTA

julia> pfm = PFM(motifs)  # sequence set => PFM
4×3 PFM{DNA, Int64}:
 A  1  0  5
 C  1  2  0
 G  1  0  0
 T  2  3  0

julia> pwm = PWM(pfm)  # PFM => PWM
4×3 PWM{DNA, Float64}:
 A -0.321928 -Inf       2.0
 C -0.321928  0.678072 -Inf
 G -0.321928 -Inf      -Inf
 T  0.678072  1.26303  -Inf

julia> pwm = PWM(pfm .+ 0.01)  # add pseudo counts to avoid infinite values
4×3 PWM{DNA, Float64}:
 A -0.319068 -6.97728   1.99139
 C -0.319068  0.673772 -6.97728
 G -0.319068 -6.97728  -6.97728
 T  0.673772  1.25634  -6.97728

julia> pwm = PWM(pfm .+ 0.01, prior=[0.2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.2])  # GC-rich prior
4×3 PWM{DNA, Float64}:
 A  0.00285965 -6.65535   2.31331
 C -0.582103    0.410737 -7.24031
 G -0.582103   -7.24031  -7.24031
 T  0.9957      1.57827  -6.65535

```

The ``PWM_{s,j}`` matrix is computed from ``PFM_{s,j}`` and the prior
probability ``p(s)`` as follows ([Wasserman2004]):

```math
\begin{align}
    PWM_{s,j} &= \log_2 \frac{p(s,j)}{p(s)} \\
    p(s,j)  &= \frac{PFM_{s,j}}{\sum_{s'} PFM_{s',j}}.
\end{align}
```

However, if you just want to quickly conduct a search, constructing the PFM and
PWM is done for you as a convenience if you build a `PWMSearchQuery`, using a
collection of sequences:

```jldoctest
julia> motifs = [dna"TTA", dna"CTA", dna"ACA", dna"TCA", dna"GTA"]
5-element Vector{LongSequence{DNAAlphabet{4}}}:
 TTA
 CTA
 ACA
 TCA
 GTA

julia> subject = dna"TATTATAATTA";

julia> qa = PWMSearchQuery(motifs, 1.0);

julia> findfirst(qa, subject)
3

```
