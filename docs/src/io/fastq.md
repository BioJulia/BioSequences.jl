# IO - FASTQ formatted files

FASTQ is a text-based file format for representing DNA sequences along with
qualities for each base.
A FASTQ file stores a list of sequence records in the following format:

```
@{name} {description}?
{sequence}
+
{qualities}
```

Here is an example of one record from a FASTQ file:

```
@FSRRS4401BE7HA
tcagTTAAGATGGGAT
+
###EEEEEEEEE##E#
```

## Readers and Writers
The reader and writer for FASTQ formatted files, are found within the
`BioSequences.FASTQ` module.

```@docs
FASTQ.Reader
FASTQ.Writer
```

They can be created with IOStreams:

```jlcon
r = FASTQ.Reader(open("MyInput.fastq", "r"))
w = FASTQ.Writer(open("MyFile.fastq", "w"))
```

Note that `FASTQ.Reader` does not support line-wraps within sequence and quality.
Usually sequence records will be read sequentially from a file by iteration.

```jlcon
using BioSequences
reader = FASTQ.Reader(open("hg38.fastq", "r"))
for record in reader
    # Do something
end
close(reader)
```

Reading in a record from a FASTQ formatted file will give you a variable of
type `FASTQ.Record`.

```@docs
FASTQ.Record
```

Various getters and setters are available for `FASTQ.Record`s:

```@docs
FASTQ.hasidentifier
FASTQ.identifier
FASTQ.hasdescription
FASTQ.description
FASTQ.hassequence
FASTQ.sequence(record::FASTQ.Record, [part::UnitRange{Int}])
FASTQ.hasquality
FASTQ.quality
```

To write a `BioSequence` to FASTQ file, you first have to create a `FASTQ.Record`:

```@docs
FASTQ.Record(identifier::AbstractString, description::Union{AbstractString,Void}, sequence, quality::Vector; offset=33)
```

As always with julia IO types, remember to close your file readers and writer
after you are finished.
