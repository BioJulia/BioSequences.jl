# Sequence Types

BioSequences exports an abstract `BioSequence` type, and several concrete sequence
types which inherit from it.

## The abstract BioSequence

BioSequences provides an abstract type called a `BioSequence{A<:Alphabet}`.
This abstract type, and the methods and traits is supports, allows for
many algorithms in BioSequences to be written as generically as possible,
thus reducing the amount of code to read and understand, whilst maintaining high
performance when such code is compiled for a concrete BioSequence subtype.
Additionally, it allows new types to be implemented that are fully compatible
with the rest of BioSequences, providing that key methods or traits are defined).

This abstract type is parametric over concrete types of `Alphabet`, which
define the range of symbols permitted in the sequence.

Some aliases are also provided for your convenience:

| Type alias      | Type                                 |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| `NucleotideSeq` | `BioSequence{<:NucleicAcidAlphabet}` |
| `AminoAcidSeq`  | `BioSequence{AminoAcidAlphabet}`     |

Any concrete sequence type compatible with BioSequences must inherit from
`BioSequence{A}`, where `A` is the alphabet of the concrete sequence type.
It must also have the following methods defined for it:

```@docs
encoded_data
Base.length(::BioSequence)
```

If these requirements are satisfied, the following key traits and methods backing
the BioSequences interface, should be defined already for the sequence type.

```@docs
encoded_data_type
encoded_data_eltype
Alphabet(::BioSequence)
BioSymbols.alphabet(::BioSequence)
BitsPerSymbol
bits_per_symbol
```

As a result, the vast majority of methods described in the rest of this manual
should work out of the box for the concrete sequence type. But they can always
be overloaded if needed.

## Long Sequences

Many genomics scripts and tools benefit from an efficient general purpose
sequence type that allows you to create and edit sequences. In BioSequences,
the `LongSequence` type fills this requirement.

`LongSequence{A<:Alphabet} <: BioSequence{A}` is parameterized by a concrete
`Alphabet` type `A` that defines the domain (or set) of biological symbols
permitted.
For example, `AminoAcidAlphabet` is associated with `AminoAcid` and hence an
object of the `LongSequence{AminoAcidAlphabet}` type represents a sequence of
amino acids.  Symbols from multiple alphabets can't be intermixed in one
sequence type.

The following table summarizes common LongSequence types that have been given
aliases for convenience.

| Type                                | Symbol type | Type alias         |
| :---------------------------------- | :---------- | :----------------- |
| `LongSequence{DNAAlphabet{4}}`      | `DNA`       | `LongDNASeq`       |
| `LongSequence{RNAAlphabet{4}}`      | `RNA`       | `LongRNASeq`       |
| `LongSequence{AminoAcidAlphabet}`   | `AminoAcid` | `LongAminoAcidSeq` |
| `LongSequence{CharAlphabet}`        | `Char`      | `LongCharSeq`      |

The `LongDNASeq` and `LongRNASeq` aliases use a DNAAlphabet{4}, which means the
sequence may store ambiguous nucleotides.
If you are sure that nucleotide sequences store unambiguous nucleotides
only, you can reduce the memory required by sequences by using a slightly
different parameter:
`DNAAlphabet{2}` is an alphabet that uses two bits per base and limits to only
unambiguous nucleotide symbols (ACGT in DNA and ACGU in RNA).
Replacing `LongSequence{DNAAlphabet{4}}` in your code with
`LongSequence{DNAAlphabet{2}}` is all you need to do in order to benefit.
Some computations that use bitwise operations will also be dramatically faster.

## Kmers & Skipmers

### Kmers

Bioinformatic analyses make extensive use of kmers.
Kmers are contiguous sub-strings of k nucleotides of some ref sequence. 

They are used extensively in bioinformatic analyses as an informational unit.
This concept popularised by short read assemblers. 
Analyses within the kmer space benefit from a simple formulation of the sampling
problem and direct in-hash comparisons.

BioSequences provides the following types to represent Kmers, unlike some
sequence types, they are immutable.

#### `Mer{A<:NucleicAcidAlphabet{2},K}`

Represents a substring of `K` DNA or RNA nucleotides (depending on the alphabet A).
This type represents the sequence using a single `UInt64`, and so the maximum
possible sequence possible - the largest `K` possible, is `32`.
We recommend using `31` rather than `32` however, as odd `K` values avoid
palindromic mers which can be problematic for some algorithms.

#### `BigMer{A<:NucleicAcidAlphabet{2},K}`

Represents a substring of `K` DNA or RNA nucleotides (depending on the alphabet A).
This type represents the sequence using a single `UInt128`, and so the maximum
possible sequence possible - the largest `K` possible, is `64`.
We recommend using `63` rather than `64` however, as odd `K` values avoid
palindromic mers which can be problematic for some algorithms.

#### `AbstractMer{A<:NucleicAcidAlphabet{2},K}`

This abstract type is just a type that unifies the `Mer` and `BigMer` types for
the purposes of writing generalised methods of functions.

Several aliases are provided for convenience:

| Type alias     | Type                        |
| :------------- | :-------------------------- |
| `DNAMer{K}`    | `Mer{DNAAlphabet{2},K}`     |
| `RNAMer{K}`    | `Mer{RNAAlphabet{2},K}`     |
| `DNAKmer`      | `DNAMer{31}`                |
| `RNAKmer`      | `RNAMer{31}`                |
| `BigDNAMer{K}` | `BigMer{DNAAlphabet{2},K}`  |
| `BigRNAMer{K}` | `BigMer{RNAAlphabet{2},K}`  |
| `BigDNAKmer`   | `BigMer{DNAAlphabet{2},63}` |
| `BigRNAKmer`   | `BigMer{RNAAlphabet{2},63}` |
| `DNACodon`     | `DNAMer{3}`                 |
| `RNACodon`     | `RNAMer{3}`                 |

### Skipmers

For some analyses, the contiguous nature of kmers imposes limitations.
A single base difference, due to real biological variation or a sequencing error,
affects all k-mers crossing that position thus impeding direct analyses by identity.
Also, given the strong interdependence of local sequence, contiguous sections
capture less information about genome structure, and so they are more affected by
sequence repetition. 

Skipmers are a generalisation of the concept of a kmer.
They are created using a cyclic pattern of used-and-skipped positions which
achieves increased entropy and tolerance to nucleotide substitution differences
by following some simple rules.

Skipmers preserve many of the elegant properties of kmers such as reverse
complementability and existence of a canonical representation.
Also, using cycles of three greatly increases the power of direct intersection
between the genomes of different organisms by grouping together the more conserved 
nucleotides of protein-coding regions.

BioSequences currently does not provide a separate type for skipmers, they are
represented using `Mer` and `BigMer` as their representation as a short immutable
sequence encoded in an unsigned integer is the same.
The distinction lies in how they are generated.

#### Skipmer generation

A skipmer is a simple cyclic q-gram that includes _m_ out of every _n_ bases
until a total of _k_ bases is reached. 

This is illustrated in the figure below (from
[this paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/08/23/179960.full.pdf).):

![skipmer-fig](skipmers.png)

To maintain cyclic properties and the existence of the reverse-complement as a
skipmer defined by the same function, _k_ should be a multiple of _m_.

This also enables the existence of a canonical representation for each skipmer,
defined as the lexicographically smaller of the forward and reverse-complement 
representations.

Defining _m_, _n_ and _k_ fixes a value for _S_, the total span of the skipmer,
given by: 

```math
S = n * (\frac{k}{m} - 1) + m
```

To see how to iterate over skipmers cf. kmers, see the Iteration section
of the manual.

## Reference sequences

`LongDNASeq` (alias of `BioSequence{DNAAlphabet{4}}`) is a flexible data
structure but always consumes 4 bits per base, which will waste a large part of
the memory space when storing reference genome sequences.  In such a case,
`ReferenceSequence` is helpful because it compresses positions of 'N' symbols so
that long DNA sequences are stored with almost 2 bits per base. An important
limitation is that the `ReferenceSequence` type is immutable due to the
compression. Other sequence-like operations are supported:

```jlcon
julia> seq = ReferenceSequence(dna"NNCGTATTTTCN")
12nt Reference Sequence:
NNCGTATTTTCN

julia> seq[1]
DNA_N

julia> seq[5]
DNA_T

julia> seq[2:6]
5nt Reference Sequence:
NCGTA

julia> ReferenceSequence(dna"ATGM")  # DNA_M is not accepted
ERROR: ArgumentError: invalid symbol M âˆ‰ {A,C,G,T,N} at 4
 in convert at /Users/kenta/.julia/v0.4/Bio/src/seq/refseq.jl:58
 in call at essentials.jl:56

```

# Alphabet types

```@docs
BioSequences.Alphabet
```

Alphabets control how biological symbols are encoded and decoded.
They also confer many of the automatic traits and methods that any subtype
of `T<:BioSequence{A<:Alphabet}` will get.
