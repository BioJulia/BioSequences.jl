# Sequences to Matrix
# -------------------

"""
    seqmatrix(vseq::AbstractVector{BioSequence{A}}, major::Symbol) where {A<:Alphabet}

Construct a matrix of nucleotides or amino acids from a vector of `BioSequence`s.

If parameter `major` is set to `:site`, the matrix is created such that one
nucleotide from each sequence is placed in each column i.e. the matrix is laid
out in site-major order.
This means that iteration over one position of many sequences is efficient,
as julia arrays are laid out in column major order.

If the parameter `major` is set to `:seq`, the matrix is created such that each
sequence is placed in one column i.e. the matrix is laid out in sequence-major
order.
This means that iteration across each sequence in turn is efficient,
as julia arrays are laid out in column major order.

# Consensus
# ---------

"""
    majorityvote(seqs::AbstractVector{LongSequence{A}}) where {A<:NucleicAcidAlphabet}

Construct a sequence that is a consensus of a vector of sequences.

The consensus is established by a simple majority vote rule, where ambiguous
nucleotides cast an equal vote for each of their possible states.
For each site a winner(s) out of A, T(U), C, or G is determined, in the cases
of ties the ambiguity symbol that unifies all the winners is returned.
E.g if A and T tie, then W is inserted in the consensus. If all A, T, C, and G
tie at a site, then N is inserted in the consensus. Note this means that if a
nucletide e.g. 'C' and a gap '-' draw, the nucleotide will always win over the
gap, even though they tied.
