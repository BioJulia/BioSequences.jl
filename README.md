## Description

BioSequences provides data types and methods for common operations with 
biological sequences, including DNA, RNA, and amino acid sequences.


## Installation

Releases of BioSequences version 2.0 and above are registered and made available
to install through BioJulia's package registry. Julia's package manager only
monitors the "General" package repository by default. So before you start, you
should tell julia about the existence of the BioJulia package registry.

Start a julia terminal, hit the `]` key to enter pkg mode (you should see the
prompt change from `julia>` to `pkg>` ), then enter the following command:

```julia
registry add https://github.com/BioJulia/BioJuliaRegistry.git
```

After you've added the registry, you can install BioSequences from the julia
REPL. Press `]` to enter pkg mode again, and enter the following:

```julia
add BioSequences
```

If you are interested in the cutting edge of the development, please check out
the master branch to try new features before release.


## Testing

BioSequences is tested against Julia `1.X` on Linux, OS X, and Windows.

### Financial contributions

We also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our
